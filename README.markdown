# Emacs Starter Kit

The Starter Kit should provide a saner set of defaults than you get
normally with Emacs. It was originally intended for beginners, but it
should provide a reasonable working environment for anyone using Emacs
for dynamic languages. It also bundles a number of useful libraries
that are not distributed with Emacs for various reasons.

The latest version is at http://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit/

# About this repository
